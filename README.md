# Calendar in python

I'm trying to create a functioning calendar in python that will work for windows 10

## How to use:

- Use the arrows on the left and right to navigate between the months
- Click on the year or month to change them more quickly, and when you wrote in you desired year or month, press enter to verify it

## To-do:

- [x] Make the calendar functional, with quickly modifiable year and month, and buttons to go through every month one by one
- [ ] Make each day clickable, and when a day is clicked, it creates new window where you can add the details of the event
- [ ] The events should be displayed, so I want to do what google calendar does on phone, and have a little space below the days and the first few words of the event can be displayed there
- [ ] and these events will also be clickable, and when clicked a new window pops up, where you can view the event
- [ ] There's a button in the event view window, to edit the event
- [ ] Maybe find a better way to change the month and year
- [ ] Store events in a json file
- [ ] Optimizations, like instead of generating each month's days every time, store them, and access them when needed
